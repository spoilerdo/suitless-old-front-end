          <br>In the start-up phase of a new organization, the legal structure is almost as important as the product or service that one wants to develop.
          A good legal structure ensures that acquired intangible assets are protected, it makes it easier for companies to collaborate with third parties.
          Furthermore, at a later stage a well-structured organization is able protect continuity with regard to the company, the product, service or production process and the people who are active within the organization.
          The big problem, however, is that creating a solid structures is often expensive, whereas in an initial phase the entrepreneur prefers to spend his money on product development and commerce.

          <br>ehvLINC runs a unique program in which it helps start-ups get their legal and tax household in order.
          With the help of Master's students and law and tax firms we help startups get their legal structure at a professional level.
          Students will work for the project 8 to 12 hours per week, with one of the selected startups.
          The students will research the possible solutions for the legal and tax problems they encounter at the start-up.
          They filter all the problems, and structure them into a legal report.
          Qualified lawyers and tax consultants will review the legal and tax report before delivering it to the start-up.
