            The incubator works with master's students from Tilburg University, from the masters Law and Technology and (International) Business law.
            The students will work for the incubator 8 - 12 hours per week.
            During this time the students will research the legal and tax issues of the start-up, make legal and tax documents for the start-up and meet with lawyers to evaluate their findings.
            This way: students obtain practical experience from a first-hand source, and get feedback from lawyers from established law firms.

            Every start-up gets in touch with our legal and tax teams.
            The legal teams will work on the basic legal documents and memo's needed to safely operate in the applicable market.
            The tax-team will focus on pointing the startup towards the optimal tax structure.
            The start-up will have to spend a maximum of two hours per week to help students get all the information they need.
            In return the start-ups will be provided with good quality legal and tax support, an insight in their tax position and high level legal documents.
